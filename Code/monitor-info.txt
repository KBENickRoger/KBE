        
Code mirror tool (monitor.exe)
=============================

The code mirror tool is a small dropbox-like utility that monitors lisp files 
and uploads them to the server when they are changed. Simply put it in the root 
folder that contains the project code and run/double-click it. 

To stop it again, right-click the icon in the system tray, in the bottom right 
corner of your desktop, and choose "Quit".


Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------
        
* Do I risk loosing my code?

	No. By design, monitor.exe doesn't change your local files. 
        
    This is a choice deeply embedded in the concept. The system doesn't try to 
    merge design changes in your code; instead, you see a list of inconsistencies 
    detected. If the code needs to change, you can copy-paste code snippets.

* Does it install anything?

	No. It is a simple executable which cleans up itself when you quit it.

* How do I remove it from my computer when I no longer need it?

	Simply quit the monitor and remove monitor.exe. That's all.

* Can I start it automatically at system startup?

	To make it start when you log in to your computer, simply make a shortcut
    to monitor.exe and place it in your startup folder. Where that folder is
    depends on your Windows version. It could be something like:
        
        C:\Users\(User-Name)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

* What files will be uploaded?

	Only *.lisp files are uploaded.

* Will files in subfolders be uploaded?

	Yes. You can e.g. place your code in a subfolder source/.

* Do you support Mac or Linux?

	Yes, but obviously monitor.exe won't cut it. If you happened to be a Mac or 
    Linux user, contact me, and I'll provide you with the necessary files and 
    support to run it on your computer.

* Can I upload confidential code safely?

	I wouldn't do that. Instead, ask me for a local installation of GendlDesign 
    on your system, so that no files leave your computer.
     
    Your code is password-protected on the server, so that other users cannot access 
    it. So there is some level of security. Still, a lot of people are able to access 
    your files:
        - Me
        - Google (the hosting provider)
        - The US government (The data is probably stored in the US)
        - People who hacked your wifi network, and other parties between you and 
          the Google servers
    
    So in short: I wouldn't do that.
